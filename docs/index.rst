Welcome to DSSATTools documentation!
====================================

DSSATTools library allows the user to create low-code scripts to run simulations using the DSSAT modeling framework. DSSATTools version 3 includes significant changes when compared to previous versions. The newer is more intuitive for the users familiar with the model, the DSSAT GUI, and the DSSAT file creation tools. Therefore, if you are new to DSSAT I highly recommend you to familiarize yourself with the model, the GUI, and the file creation Tools before jumping into using this library.
